\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This assignment is to be completed in groups of 3-4. Further, all
students in your group need to be assigned to the same R tutorial group
(Friday's tutorial). You can sign yourself up for a group on Canvas.
Please do so
\textbf{before the start of your first R tutorial on Friday September 5th.}
You can use the Discussion Board in Canvas if you do not have a group
yet or if your group is incomplete.

The assignment has 5 parts, and each part corresponds to the course
material of that week (with the exclusion of week 6, for which there is
no R programming material).

You are supposed to hand in these assignments on Canvas at the following
dates:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Deadline 1} \emph{Thursday September 25th, at 23:59pm}: you
  are supposed to hand in weeks 1, 2, and 3 of this assignment. This
  will determine 18\% of your overall course grade
\item
  \textbf{Deadline 2} \emph{Thursday October 9th, at 23:59pm}: you are
  supposed to hand in weeks 4, and 5 of this assignment. This will
  determine 12\% of your overall course grade
\end{itemize}

The R tutorials (each Friday) will consist of two halves. During the
first half, you will discuss the tutorial exercises. These can be
downloaded separately from Canvas. During the second half, you can work
on this graded assignment within your own group. The purpose is that you
find out how to work with R for doing statistical analyses by yourself.
The tutorial exercises are meant to teach you basic commands to get you
started, but to answer the problem sets in this assignment, you might
need to research your own solutions, and use functions and commands not
described in the tutorial exercises. Learning how to solve your own
research problems is integral part of learning R. When you and your
group get stuck on how to approach an exercise, the hierarchy in finding
your way is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  use the concepts from the tutorial exercises;
\item
  use the cheat sheets available on Canvas;
\item
  use Google, YouTube, StackOverflow, or another website;
\item
  ask the teacher.
\end{itemize}

The use of generative AI is \textbf{not} permitted and may result in a
grade of 0. See the AI protocol in the course manual for details.

To answer the assignment, you can simply fill out this R markdown
document. There are designated places which you can fill with R code.
There are also designated spaces for you to answer each question. Often,
the structure of an answer will be as follows. First, you type the R
code in the designated box. This will show how you analyzed the data to
get the answer to the question. Below the box for the R code, you will
then summarize your answer to the question, i.e.~what are the
conclusions that you draw from the data analysis?

When handing in, you are supposed to submit this .Rmd file, and a
knitted version of this document. You can knit this document to pdf,
word, or html. Knitting to pdf requires you to have a .tex distribution
installed on your computer. Knitting to Word requires you to have Word
installed.

The exercises are designed such that you should be able to finish the
majority of them during the tutorial each week. If you are not able to
finish them fully during that time, you are expected to work on it in
your own time using the computers on campus or your own device. It is
best to meet as a group in-person when working together. If you want to
work remotely, github is a good platform to guarantee smooth
collaboration. Alternatively, you can email this .Rmd file back and
forth to one another as a group, but this is not recommended as it is
more cumbersome.

We encourage you to keep your code blocks, printing statements, and
final answers, as short as possible. In any case, there is a page limit
of 6 pages per week, which encompasses the total length of this document
which consists of the questions, your coding lines, and your answers.
When your answers to questions of the respective week exceed this page
limit, they will not be graded, resulting in zero points.

Each week consists of 1, 2, or 3 subquestions. The total amount of
points you can earn per week is 20 points.

  Create the variable profits as the revenue of a movie minus its
  budget. Report its mean, median, maximum, and minimum.

  Which movie has the highest profits in your data set and how much are
  these profits. Which movie has the lowest and how much are its
  profits? If multiple movies have the exact same highest or lowest
  profits, give only one example. \textbf{[2 points]}
\item
  Create a boxplot of the variable profits. Make sure it has an
  appropriate title, and appropriate titles and labels for the x- and
  y-axis. Give Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. What does this tell you about the
  nature of making money in the movies industry? \textbf{[2 points]}

  Add a new variable to your data set the log of profits. When creating
  this variable, what happens to movies for which profits is zero or
  negative? What then happens when you calculate the mean of log of
  profits? \textbf{[2 points]}
\item
  For movies that have a profit of zero or less, replace log of profits
  with ``NA''. What is now the mean of log of profits? Create a boxplot
  for log of profits, again with an appropriate title, x- and y-axis
  labels. How does it compare to the boxplot you made under c.)?

  Create a scatterplot of with the runtime of movies on the x-axis and
  the average vote of movies on the y-axis. What do you conclude from
  the scatterplot? Are movies with a longer runtime considered worse or
  better by the audience, or does the audience not have a preference?
  Why do you think this is the case? \textbf{[2 points]}

For each step, you should provide first all the code you used to answer
the question and then formulate an answer using full sentences.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{Assignment2_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-2.pdf}}

\textbf{Your Answer:}

We created two boxplots. The first code is for all variable data in the
dataset. The resulting boxplot is very compact with many outliers. In
the second code, which was written to create the boxplot, the outliers
were removed. We did this using the line \#outline = FALSE\#. This
provides a more specific view of the distribution of variable profit.

We calculated the quartiles based on all the data, including the
outliers. These are the quartiles: Q1 = 0 Q2 = 1.900.000 Q3 = 60.514.050
Q4 = 2.550.965.087

This data tells us that the movie industry is a high-risk, high-reward
business, where the majority of films earn little, and profitability is
driven by a small fraction of massive blockbusters.

\begin{verbatim}
##   mean_profits
## 1     17.38094

\textbf{Your Answer:}

All films without profit are converted to -infinity, because the value
of log(0) is not defined for any base of the logarithm All films with a
negative profit are converted to NaN, which means that the result of a
mathematical calculation is not a valid number. This is because the
logarithm is only defined for positive real numbers.

As a result, when calculating the average logarithm of profits, films
with zero or negative profits are excluded from the calculation, as
their logarithm values are undefined. The average then only reflects
films with positive profits, which distorts the result because
loss-making or break-even films are not taken into account.

\textbf{Your Answer:}

Because the values now lie within a more manageable scale, the boxplot
provides more information than in c.~Additionally, all negative values
have been removed from the data, so only positive values are visible in
the boxplot. However, there are still outliers, which can be seen as the
