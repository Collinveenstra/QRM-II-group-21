# Week 4 

1. There is another argument going on in the movie studio. *Bob* claims that production budgets are getting out of hand, and that the studio should focus on making cheaper movies. *Chantal* disagrees. She tells Bob that ``Every dollar we spend on movie production is more than offset by the increase in movie profits''. 

a. Set up a regression model to test Chantal's claim, and estimate it. That is, estimate: $$\text{Profits}_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 \text{Budget}_i +\varepsilon_i.$$ Print a summary of your estimated model. \textbf{[2 points]}
b. What is the estimated value of $\beta_1$ and how do you interpet it? \textbf{[2 points]}
c. Test for the null hypothesis that $\beta_1 \geq 0$. Report the p-value and state your conclusion. \textbf{[2 points]} 
d. Next, estimate the model $$\text{Log Profits}_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 \text{Log Budget}_i +\varepsilon_i.$$ When creating the variables Log Profits and Log Budget, make sure that movies with a Revenue or Budget of zero are assigned the value "NA". Print a summary of your estimated model \textbf{[2 points]}
e. What is the estimated value of $\beta_1$ and how do you interpet it? \textbf{[2 points]}
f. Which model has better fit? The level-level model or the log-log model? Explain. \textbf{[2 points]}
g. Who do you think is correct? Bob or Chantal? What would you advise the movie studio to do? \textbf{[2 points]}

*step a*

```{r}
#WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
movies <- read.table("movies1.tsv", header=TRUE)

model <- lm(revenue ~ budget, data = movies)
summary(model)

```

**Your Answer:**

You can see the summary up here. 

*step b*

```{r}
#WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
summary(model)
```

**Your Answer:**

The estimated value of Beta 1 is 3.677. This means that each additional dollar spent on production, is an increase of 3.677 dollar in profits.

a. Make a plot with a 95% confidence interval with the mean log of budget on the y-axis, and whether the first actor of the movie is male or female on the x-axis. What do you conclude? \textbf{[2 points]} 
b. Estimate the following simple OLS model: $log(budget)_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 \text(FirstActorMale)_i + \varepsilon_i.$ Is the estimated coefficient for $\beta_1$ significantly different from zero? How do you interpret its estimate, and how does this relate to your conclusion in 2a? \textbf{[2 points]}
c. Now, have a close look at your data frame. Can you find any instances of male first actors who are wrongly labeled as being female, or vice versa? What would such mislabelling mean for the coefficient you estimated under 2b? \textbf{[2 points]}

*step a*

```{r}
#WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
install.packages("Hmisc")
library (tidyverse)
library (Hmisc)

movies <- subset(movies, budget >0)
movies$log_budget <- log(movies$budget)

ggplot(movies, aes(x = first_actor_gender, y = log_budget)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 3) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Gender of First Actor", y = "Log of Budget",
       title = "Mean Log of Budget by First Actor Gender with 95% Confidence Interval")
```

**Your Answer:**

This plot shows that the average log-budget of films with a male first actor is slightly higher than that of films with a female first actor, but there is a large overlap of confidence intervals. This means there is no clear statistical difference between the groups. For the NA group, the uncertainty is so large that no conclusion can be drawn.

# Week 5

a. Create a plot of the mean profits by month of release. Do you see any indication that month of release matters to the profits of the movie? \textbf{[2 points]}
b. Estimate an OLS model which has as dependent variable the log of profits of a movie, and as independent variable the log of budget, a dummy for whether the movie was released in english or not, and a linear term for the month of release. Show a summary of the resulting model and interpret each coefficient. \textbf{[4 points]}
c. Test for the hypothesis that the coefficient that belongs to month of release is zero. \textbf{[2 points]} 
d. Based on your plot in a.) do you consider the choice that month of release enters the model linearly under b.) reasonable? Estimate a specification that allows for a more flexible curve. In this new specification, test for the null hypothesis that month of release does not impact profits. This might require testing multiple terms at once. \textbf{[4 points]}

e. One executive at the studio wants to time the release of the movie to a specific month of the year such that they can maximize revenue. Based on your model under d.), What would you advise the movie studio regarding the timing of the release of the movie?  \textbf{[2 points]}

The movie studio that you work at is releasing a new movie in 2026. It will be an English-spoken Thriller movie with a budget of 40,000,0000. 

f. Estimate a model that is able to predict the revenue of this movie. Give its predicted revenue and include a 99% prediction interval.  \textbf{[6 points]}
